learning git

exercise 1

1. create a new repository
2. create a new file, add it to the index and commit it
3. launch gitk to display it. Keep the window open and hit F5 after each
command (to visualise the results of your commands)
4. modify the file and make a new commit
5. rename the file (either with git mv or git add+git rm), do a git status
before committing (to ensure the renaming is correctly handled)
6. delete the file and commit it
7. create two new files and commit them. Then modify their content in the
working copy and display the changes with git diff
8. add one file into the index but keep the other one. Display the changes
between:
• the index and the working copy
• the last commit and the index
• the last commit and the working copy
9. run git reset to reset the index
10. run git reset --hard to reset the index and the working copy
